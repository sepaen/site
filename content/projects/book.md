Bureau Sep√§n's first book as a publishing house focuses on the works done by FLEE around their first issue focusing on Benga music.

A result of months of exchanges, discussions and encouters, this publication tackles different controversial topics such as cultural appropriation or the digitalisation of artistic practices in today's age. 

With the exceptionnal contributions of artists, academics and professionals such as Mbithi Masya, KMRU, Atelier UZehn, Andrew Eisenberg and many more, "Benga, A Kenyan Kaleidoscope" represents a collection on insights and ideas about cleaving themes approached in a new light.
