For this very first issue of the FLEE publication we wanted to deliver a unique and complementary object.

</br>

The packaging and graphic concept for the silkscreen printed magazine were done in collaboration with Atelier U-Zehn while the cover of the vinyl is an original composition from Olka Osadzinska.

We've curated the written and audial material bringing together artists, journalists, thinkers and musicians to give a precise and respectful picture of the Kenyan musical genre that is Benga.

Limited edition of 800 copies distributed worldwide.
