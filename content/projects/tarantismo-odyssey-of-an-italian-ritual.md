For this second release of the [FLEE platform](http://www.fleeproject.com/), we have been curating the editorial and design of a challenging and transmedial project dedicated to Tarantism, an ancient Italian trance ritual. 

</br>

The initiative brings together artists, journalists, doctors, priests, intellectuals and musicians invited to reflect on this subject.

</br>

Giving an exhaustive and challenging aesthetical perspective on this obscure music phenomenon, we supervised with an academic rigor the entire research, while articulating a sensorial narrative between the distinct objects, in collaboration with graphic design practice [Non-Verbal Club](https://nonverbalclub.pt/).

Limited edition of 1000 copies distributed worldwide.
