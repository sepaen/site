For this second release of [FLEE](http://www.fleeproject.com), we worked on a new concept building a narrative between the distinct objects.

</br>

With the collaboration of graphic bureau [Non-Verbal Club](https://nonverbalclub.pt/), we've made the different central actors of the chosen topic (women, spiders, occult) interact in a user experience manner. 

</br>

We've curated the written and audial material bringing together artists, journalists, doctors, priests, thinkers and musicians to give a precise and respectful picture of the Kenyan musical genre that is Benga.

</br>

Limited edition of 1000 copies distributed worldwide.
