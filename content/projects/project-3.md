Last July, the [Eeeeh](http://www.eeeeh.ch/) and [Hapax21](http://c-h-21.tumblr.com/) collectives based in Nyon, Switzerland commissioned an exhibition around the first issue of [FLEE](https://fleeproject.com/)'s project.

Bureau Sep√§n overtook the scenography and organisation of a permanent space for two weeks covering different creative ground with the organisation of a conference cycle and different creative workshops held around music production and riso printing.
