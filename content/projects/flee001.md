For this very first issue of the [FLEE](http://www.fleeproject.com) publication we wanted to deliver a unique and complementary object.

</br>

The packaging and graphic concept for the silkscreen printed magazine were done in collaboration with [Atelier U-Zehn](http://u-zehn.ch/) while the cover of the vinyl is an original composition from [Olka Osadzinska](http://www.aleosa.com/).

</br>

We've curated the written and audial material bringing together artists, journalists, thinkers and musicians to give a precise and respectful picture of the Kenyan musical genre that is Benga.

</br>

Limited edition of 800 copies distributed worldwide.
